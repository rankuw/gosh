# Gosh (Go-Shell)
**Status: Under Active Development**

A custom Unix shell implementation in Go. I am building this to master systems programming, process management, and the Go standard library.

## 🛠 Current Progress
- [x] Basic command execution (fork/exec logic)
- [x] Path resolution for system binaries
- [x] Built-in command support (`cd`, `exit`)
- [ ] I/O Redirection (In Progress)
- [ ] Pipes (Planned)

## 🏃 Run
```bash
go run app/main.go
